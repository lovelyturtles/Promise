Iteration 1 Worksheet
=====================

Adding a feature: Manage Project
-----------------

As all of the tasks in our application will be tied to a *Project* that a user is a part of, the 'Manage Project' functionality has been given a high priority from the beginning. Users can build a project and invite others to join it, or they can send join requests to other projects.

Our team's initial plan was to implement all user stories related to this feature, but we have decided to push user stories for Project invites/join requests to the next iteration, and only implement the developer tasks for 'Create Project'. Our team made this choice as we wanted to ensure that our project and user classes had a solid basis before introducing features that would integrate both.

The 'Create Project' user story was broken into many tasks, as creating a project involves viewing all created projects and details of one particular project.

Links to user stories, merge requests, merge commits and tests can be found bellow.

Exceptional code
----------------

Provide a link to a test of exceptional code. In a few sentences,
provide an explanation of why the exception is handled or thrown
in the code you are testing.

Branching
----------
Our branching strategy can be found in our [README.md](./README.md).

![Branch Graph](./images/branch_graph.png)
From this image, nothing has merged into the main branch yet, but it can be seen that all the development was done on each member's branch and was merged into the iteration1 branch.

SOLID
-----

On *March 02 3:30 PM*, Group 7 has not made any significant updates on their program, and only had `MainActivity.java`.
Hence, our team was not able to find any SOLID validations, and did not create any issues.


Agile Planning
--------------

Write a paragraph about any plans that were changed. Did you
'push' any features to iteration 2? Did you change the description
of any Features or User Stories? Have links to any changed or pushed Features
or User Stories.
