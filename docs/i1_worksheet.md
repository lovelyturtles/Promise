SOLID
-----

On *March 02 3:30 PM*, Group 7 has not made any significant updates on their program, and only had `MainActivity.java`.
Hence, our team was not able to find any SOLID validations, and did not create any issues.


Agile Planning
--------------

Write a paragraph about any plans that were changed. Did you
'push' any features to iteration 2? Did you change the description
of any Features or User Stories? Have links to any changed or pushed Features
or User Stories.
